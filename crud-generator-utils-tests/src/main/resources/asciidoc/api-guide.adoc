= Introduction

The API provides CRUD operations and history access for all domain entities.

= Overview



[[overview-http-verbs]]

== HTTP verbs



RESTful API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its

use of HTTP verbs.



|===

| Verb | Usage



| `GET`

| Used to retrieve a resource



| `POST`

| Used to create a new resource



| `PATCH`

| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates



| `DELETE`

| Used to delete an existing resource

|===



[[overview-http-status-codes]]

== HTTP status codes



RESTful API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its

use of HTTP status codes.



|===

| Status code | Usage



| `200 OK`

| The request completed successfully



| `201 Created`

| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's

`Location` header



| `204 No Content`

| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully



| `400 Bad Request`

| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information



| `404 Not Found`

| The requested resource did not exist

|===



[[overview-errors]]

== Errors



Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object

that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:



include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]



For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent tag to a civility will produce a

`400 Bad Request` response:



include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]



[[overview-hypermedia]]

== Hypermedia



RESTful API uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their

responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application

from resource to resource.

Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should

not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate



[[resources]]

= Resources







[[resources-index]]

== Index



The index provides the entry point into the service.







[[resources-index-access]]

=== Accessing the index



A `GET` request is used to access the index
